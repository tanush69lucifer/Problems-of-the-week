WEEK 9

1. Swap Even and Odd Bits
Given an 8-bit integer, swap every even-positioned bit with the adjacent odd-positioned bit.  
Example: 10101010 → 01010101, 11100010 → 11010001.


2. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array of numbers.  
The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, but the order must be maintained.  
Example: `[0,8,4,12,2,10,6,14,1,9,5,13,3,11,7,15]` → LIS length = 6 (`[0,2,6,9,11,15]`).


3. Bitwise AND of a Range 
Compute the bitwise AND of all integers between M and N (inclusive).  
The result keeps only the common prefix in binary of M and N.  
Example: M=5, N=7 → 4; M=0, N=1 → 0.
